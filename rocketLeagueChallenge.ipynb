Size the dataset down; you should be able to use something akin to: df.groupby('target_col').sample(frac=0.n) where n=% of data we want to keep \n","    c. Compare distributions of training data to that of test data; use the ks2 test to determine if columns are of the same distribution \n","    d. Determine proper types for each column.
